Problem Statement:
Design a Ride Booking System (like Ola/Uber) where users can choose different types of rides like:

- Bike
- Auto
- Mini
- Sedan

Each ride type has different:
- Base fare
- Per km rate
- Per minute rate

System should:
- Allow booking a ride by selecting ride type.
- Calculate fare dynamically based on distance and time.
- Be easily extensible â€” so that new ride types (e.g., SUV, EV) can be added without touching existing code.

ðŸ”¥ Use Strategy Design Pattern to implement this system.
